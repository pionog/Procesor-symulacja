# Procesor symulacja (in English: Processor simulation)
## Overview
This game was created as a project for the subject "Video Games Development" at my university.
<br><br>
This game is heavily influenced by the program which is available on this GitHub page: https://github.com/jmaebe/ESCAPE.
<br>
It is also the reason why this game was created, as the interface of this program is now outdated and thus makes it difficult to learn about the architecture of RISC-type processors.

## Objective
The player's main task is to implement the Finite impulse response algorithm for a specified array of numbers in such a way as to calculate the correct result in as few ARM processor clock cycles as possible.
To do this, the player should design new mnemonics that combine several others. By doing so, he saves several clock cycles, since the processor does not need to consume them to search for a given mnemonic, which would be executed in such a created combination.
